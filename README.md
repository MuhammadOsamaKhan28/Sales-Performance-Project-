# Sales Performance Dashboard  
**Domain & Objective**  
During my internship, I built a sales-performance dashboard using Power BI to support a retail/wholesale business. The goal: to provide leadership with an interactive, intuitive view of the business’s financial and operational health—tracking revenue, cost, profit, order volumes, returns, sold quantities and segment-level behaviours.

**Tools & Approach**  
- Microsoft Power BI (Power Query + DAX) for data ingestion, modelling and visualisation  
- Interactive KPIs, slicers (Year, Quarter, Month), dynamic titles and filters for flexible exploration  
- Visual layout: Executive summary section + segmentation views (customer demographics, region, product, time)  
- Visual types: KPI cards, pie/donut charts, bar/column charts, treemap for region, time-series line chart  

**Key Insights & Findings**  
- The dashboard’s main summary presents total revenue, total cost, profit, number of orders, sold quantity and number of returns — offering a quick “business health” check.  
- Product-level insight: the top-selling product in the filtered view secured 61 units sold (e.g., “Tri-State Plums”).  
- Customer segmentation: Sold quantity by gender shows ~51.6 % male, ~48.4 % female — indicating gender-balance in this sample.  
- Member card segmentation: Bronze tier leads in sold quantity (approx 24 K units in the view) followed by Normal (~11 K), Golden (~6 K) and Silver (~4 K) — indicating strong volume from basic loyalty tier.  
- Occupation segmentation: Professionals generate highest volume (~15 K units), followed by Skilled Manual (~12 K), Manual (~11 K), Management (~6 K) and Clerical (~1 K) — identifying high-value occupational segments.  
- Geographic breakdown: Region “North West” ~17 K units, “Mexico Central” ~13 K units in one sample timeframe — showing regional concentration of sales.  
- Multi-year/aggregate summary: across the dataset ~1.76 M total revenue, ~711.7 K total cost, ~1.05 M total profit, ~833 K sold units, ~270 K orders, ~7 087 returns.  
- Profit share by country: USA ~66.75 %, Mexico ~27.14 %, Canada ~6.11 % — pointing to dominant profitability from a single market.  
- Monthly revenue trend: e.g., revenue rising from ~144 K in Jan to ~177 K in Dec — showing seasonality and year-end surge.  
- Top sold products list: e.g., “Tell Tale Free…” ~698 units, “Steady White…” ~684 units — useful for inventory & promotion focus.  
- Profit by occupation: Professionals lead (~342.5 K), then Skilled Manual (~283.96 K), Manual (~255.95 K), Management (~152.16 K), Clerical (~18.25 K) — highlighting where margin is strongest.  
- Customer-count by country: USA ~7.4 K customers, Mexico ~1.2 K, Canada ~1.7 K — supporting country-specific customer strategy.

**Business & Real-World Impact**  
- Provides senior management with a **single pane of glass** for key metrics enabling rapid assessment of business performance.  
- Helps identify **high-value customer segments** (by occupation, card-tier, region) so that marketing, loyalty and product strategies can be more finely tuned.  
- Product insights (top-selling, most-returned items) allow inventory optimisation, promotion targeting and return mitigation.  
- Monthly and seasonal revenue trend analysis supports **capacity planning**, staffing decisions, promotional timing and price strategies.  
- Geographic and segmentation insights enable targeted resource allocation, regional sales strategies and channel optimisation.  
- A well-designed dashboard (in line with Power BI best practices) ensures the insights are **accessible**, **intuitive** and **actionable**.

**Why It Matters**  
In today’s data-driven environment, organisations need more than static reports—they need interactive dashboards that allow dynamic filtering, quick segmentation and high-level to detailed drill-down. This dashboard delivers that by combining robust data modelling, intuitive visual design and a clear business narrative. It bridges the gap between raw data and decision-making, enabling the organisation to act with confidence and agility.

**Portfolio Summary**  
This project, undertaken during my internship, displays my full-life-cycle analytics capability: from data ingestion and model building through to designing a user-centric interactive visualisation and delivering business-relevant insights. It illustrates how I can bridge the gap between raw transactional data and strategic decision-making for a sales-driven organisation.
